**Date:** November 20, 2025  
**Analyst:** Student 22311351007

## Interface Context
- **URL:** https://www.kwezybuses.com/index.php
- **Type:** Transportation booking website
- **Purpose:** Bus ticket information and booking for Malawi intercity routes
- **Industry:** Transportation/Travel

## First Impressions
- **Visual Design:** Basic, minimal styling
- **Information Density:** Very high - overwhelming amount of data
- **Navigation:** Limited or unclear
- **User Flow:** No clear path to book tickets
- **Mobile Experience:** Likely problematic due to large tables

## Target User Groups
1. **Local Travelers:** Malawians booking intercity bus trips
2. **Tourists:** International visitors planning travel within Malawi
3. **Regular Commuters:** Frequent travelers checking schedules/prices
4. **Travel Agents:** Booking on behalf of clients

## Primary User Goals
- Find available routes between two specific cities
- Compare ticket prices (adult vs child, single vs return)
- Understand journey details (duration, stops, amenities)
- Book and pay for tickets online
- Receive booking confirmation

## Current User Journey
1. User lands on homepage
2. User sees massive list of all routes
3. User must manually scroll and search for their specific route
4. User finds price information
5. **Dead end** - no way to proceed with booking

## Initial Problems Identified

### Navigation & Information Architecture
- No search functionality for routes
- No filter options (by origin, destination, price, etc.)
- All 23+ routes shown simultaneously
- No clear categorization or grouping

### Visual Design
- Inconsistent capitalization ("kasungu" vs "Blantyre")
- Poor visual hierarchy
- Limited use of color or visual cues
- Tables dominate the interface

### Functionality
- No booking system
- No date selection
- No seat selection
- No payment integration
- Static information display only

### Accessibility
- Low contrast in some areas
- No alternative text considerations
- Potential screen reader issues with table structure
- No keyboard navigation indicators

## Screenshots Reference
- See `screenshots/` folder for visual documentation
- 5 key screenshots captured for evaluation

## Next Steps
1. Conduct full heuristic evaluation (Nielsen's 10 Heuristics)
2. Document specific usability violations
3. Map user pain points
4. Begin redesign planning
