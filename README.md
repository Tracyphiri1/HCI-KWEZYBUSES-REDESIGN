# Kwezy Buses Website Redesign
## HCI Comprehension Project - Problem Three

**Student ID:** 22311351007  
**Module:** Comprehension - Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)  
**Module Code:** 351 CP 81  
**Tool:** Figma  
**Project Duration:** November 20 - December 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## 📋 Project Overview

Comprehensive redesign of the Kwezy Buses website (https://www.kwezybuses.com) to improve usability, accessibility, and user experience for bus ticket booking in Malawi. This project applies Nielsen's Heuristics, user-centered design principles, and WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards to transform a poorly designed interface into a modern, functional booking platform.

---

## 🎯 Original Interface Problems Identified

### Critical Issues (Severity 4)
1. ❌ **No search functionality** - Users forced to manually scan 23+ routes
2. ❌ **No booking system** - Cannot complete primary task online (0% success rate)
3. ❌ **Information overload** - All routes displayed simultaneously without hierarchy

### Major Issues (Severity 3)
4. ❌ No system status feedback
5. ❌ Poor navigation and user control
6. ❌ Inconsistent formatting ("kasungu" vs "Blantyre")
7. ❌ High cognitive load (recognition vs recall)
8. ❌ Missing help documentation

### Additional Problems
- Mobile unusable (requires constant zooming)
- Fails WCAG accessibility standards
- No filtering or sorting capabilities
- Redundant route listings
- Poor visual hierarchy

## 🔬 Evaluation Methodology

### Heuristic Evaluation Framework
**Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics** used to systematically identify violations:

1. ✅ Visibility of system status
2. ✅ Match between system and real world
3. ✅ User control and freedom
4. ✅ Consistency and standards
5. ✅ Error prevention
6. ✅ Recognition rather than recall
7. ✅ Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. ✅ Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. ✅ Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. ✅ Help and documentation

### Severity Rating Scale
- **Severity 4:** Catastrophic - Must fix immediately
- **Severity 3:** Major - High priority
- **Severity 2:** Minor - Low priority
- **Severity 1:** Cosmetic - Fix if time permits

**Results:** 10/10 heuristics violated in original interface (avg severity: 3.0)

## 👥 User Research

### Personas Developed

**1. Grace Mwale (Local Commuter)**
- Age 28, Teacher, Monthly traveler
- Needs: Quick booking, mobile access
- Pain Point: "Why can't I just search for my route?"

**2. James Wilson (International Tourist)**
- Age 35, British visitor, First-time user
- Needs: Trip planning, advance booking
- Pain Point: "This is just a price list?"

**3. Mr. Henry Banda (Elderly Traveler)**
- Age 67, Retired, Occasional traveler
- Needs: Simple interface, clear guidance
- Pain Point: "There's too much here. I need help."
